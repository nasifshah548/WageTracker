If you want WageTracker to be modern, flexible, and universally useful, here’s a list of smart, impactful features that will take your 
app from a handy tool to a global solution:

- Let users select their local currency (USD, EUR, INR, etc.).

- Automatically format amounts based on selection.

- Optionally fetch live exchange rates to convert earnings.

🗓️ 3. Custom Workweek Configuration
